# Compound-Interest-Calculator

This program is a compound interest calculator that allows users to compute the future value of an investment based on the principal amount, interest rate, and time period in years. Users input the principal amount they want to invest, the annual interest rate, and the number of years the money will be invested. The program then calculates and displays the total amount after the specified time, including both the principal and the interest earned.
